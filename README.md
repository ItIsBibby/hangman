# Hangman

This is a hangman game app.

## Description

I built it as part of a Web Development course with HyperionDev, as an exercise using React Redux.

React redux is used to handle the state, which is passed across all of the app's components.

If you've played hangman you should know what to expect.

I've tried to make it user-friendly, so each guess you make is reflected in the UI, and the letters you didn't get right are revealed when the game ends.

## Running the app

Using npm start in the app directory will run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
